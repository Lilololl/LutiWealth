                    <p>Gaming cosmetics in CS:GO are items that can be used to customize 
                      the appearance of a player's weapons, characters, and other in-game items. 
                      Cosmetic items in CS:GO do not affect gameplay in any way. They are purely 
                      for aesthetic purposes. However, some players choose to collect cosmetic items
                      as a way to show off their status or support their favorite teams.
                      Cosmetics can be optained in different ways:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Opeing Loot crates which contain specific skins of different rarity and value. </li>
                        <li>Weapon skins can also be traded up to. This works by using skins of lower rarity
                            of the same collection or case. There are ten skins of the same rarity needed to get 
                            a skin one rarity higher. Each skin gives a 10% chance to get its corresponding higher tier.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cosmetics can also be obtained as drops while playing the game or after attending or playing an
                            official Valve event.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                  </p>
                </div>
