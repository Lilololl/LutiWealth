          <h2>Arbitrage Bot</h2>
          <p>
            We are currently making great progress on building our own arbitrage bot. 
            This bot will be able to profit from short term price differences between different markets.
            As of now we are experimenting on connecting two marketplaces, one located in Germany and on in China.
            The strategy is as follows: We buy a skin on the German marketplace and sell it on the Chinese marketplace with a profit.
            More specifically, we constantly scan the German marketplace for skins which have at least a 15% price difference to the Chinese marketplace.
            If a skin is found, we buy it and after the trade hold of 8 to 16 days is past, we sell it on the Chinese marketplace.
            This strategy is very low risk, because we are nearly guaranteed to make a profit, as long as the prices dont encounter a major shift.
            This risk occurcs because of the previously mentioned trade hold. If the price of the skin drops more than our margin during the trade hold, we will make a loss.
            While this worst case scenario is very unlikely, we are still working on a solution to minimize the risk even further.
            The bot is currently running on a test account and we are monitoring its performance and further optimizing it.
            The big problem we're currently facing is that the bot has a limited capacity for capital because of the reduced number of trades availabel on the market.
            Our goal is to have a fully functional bot which can return a summarized profit of 5% to 20% per month.

            <h2>Capsule Fund</h2>
            <p>
                We are right now in the middle of assembling a new fund which will contain so called 'Major Capsules'. 
                These Capsules are only available during the Major tournaments and get discontinued after. 
                They contain stickers of the participating teams which can be unboxed and applied onto the weapon skins.
                Because of the limited supply and in most cases steady demand, these capsules can present a good investment opportunity
                with a low risk factor. The return on the other hand can vary very much depending on game internal factors like sticker application rate
                and rare animations of stickers contained in such capsules, as well as external factors like the disbanding of a team.
